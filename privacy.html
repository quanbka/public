                                Linkage does not track your search engine history, emails, or your browsing on any site that is not a retail website (a site where you can shop and make a purchase). When you are on a pre-approved retail site, to help you save money, Linkage will collect information about that site that lets us know which coupons and promos to find for you. We may also collect information about pricing and availability of items, which we can share with the rest of the Linkage community.<br><br><i>Shopping and Usage Data.</i><br><br>
                                On retail sites, Linkage collects the name of the retailer, page views, and in some cases, product information that allows us to track price changes and update our product catalog. We may also collect information regarding your purchases on a retail site while using Linkage (for example, the transaction value, and the fact that an order was completed or returned) for purposes including internal analytics, commission collection, and managing Rewards. The information you share, and we collect, enables us to improve our products and gives us insights about coupons, deals, pricing, and availability of retail items, which we can share with the rest of the Linkage community. We may also use this information to understand your shopping history, merchant and shopping preferences to provide you with a more tailored, relevant experience or show sponsored product offers that may interest you.<br><br><i>Aggregate and Anonymized Data</i><br><br>
                                We may also use the information we collect in aggregate or otherwise anonymized form. This lets us look at interactions with our site and products generally and does not identify you or any specific person. We use this general data for research, development, marketing, analytics, and to enhance the shopping experience for the Linkage community.<br><br><i>What data we do not collect</i><br><br>
                                We collect information that we believe can help us save our users time and money. This does <strong>not</strong> include, and we do <strong>not</strong> collect, any information from your search engine history, emails, or from websites that are not retail sites.<br><br>
                                We also do not collect bank or credit card information (unless you expressly provide those to us when you make a purchase through Linkage).

                                We know how important your personal data is to you, so we will never sell it without your express permission first. We'll only share your personal data with your consent or in ways you'd expect (as we explain here). That means we will share your data if needed to complete your purchase, with businesses who help us operate Linkage, or if we are legally required to do so.<br><br>
                                We may share information with our service providers (businesses that work for and with us) for the purpose of running Linkage and fulfilling our commitments to you. These include businesses that perform services on our behalf, including to help us maintain our products, to provide support for legal, banking, security protection, payment processing, our own marketing, and customer service. Please know that when we share information with our service providers, it's for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement and not for their independent use.<br><br>
                                We may also share information in the following cases:

                              These measures include limiting access, using encryption, testing for vulnerabilities, advanced malware detection, employing pseudonymization and anonymization techniques, and more.<br><br>
                              Though we hate to say it, despite our efforts, we can't guarantee that user information will not be accessed, viewed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed as a result of a breach of any of our safeguards. You provide us with information at your own risk.<br><br>
                              Linkage only retains information about you as long as you keep using Linkage, though we’ll keep information if we need it to meet our legal obligations and to defend against legal claims.

                                Our rewards program, sometimes referred to as Linkage Gold or Linkage Rewards, is offered with Linkage (together, “Rewards”) and provides you with the ability to earn points on eligible purchases, eligible Linkage transactions, or completing other actions, such as referring a friend.<br><br>
                                The Rewards can be earned through our website, the Linkage app, or through checkout and can be redeemed for gift cards, Linkage transaction discounts or cash back with a valid Linkage account.  You can earn Rewards on purchases from eligible merchants, eligible Linkage transactions or other activity.  The Rewards are subject to these <a aria-label="Linkage Rewards Program Agreement" href="https://www.linkage.store/us/webapps/mpp/ua/pp-rewards-program-tnc">Linkage Rewards Program Agreement</a>.  Additional terms and exclusions may apply and are presented at the time the Reward is offered or saved.<br><br>
                                To manage Rewards the following Personal information is collected:
                                <ul><li>Identifiers, such as name and email and account location</li><li>Shopping and Usage Information, such as shopping history, transaction value and returns</li><li>Preferred merchants or categories</li><li>Internet and Network activity such as IP address</li><li>Inferences drawn from one or more of the above, including a consumer's shopping history, that reflects a consumer’s shopping preferences.</li></ul>
                                You opt into Rewards by registering for the Linkage Services.  You have the right to opt-out of the Rewards program by contacting customer support at <a aria-label="Privacy Email" href="mailto:privacy@joinlinkage.store">privacy@joinlinkage.store</a>, or you may uninstall or delete your account at any time.<br><br>
                                To form the basis for the Rewards offered, Linkage made the following good faith estimate of the value of the consumers’ data based on the rewards granted by the business divided by the number of active participants over the past 12 months. We estimate the value of users’ personal information to be $15 per user.
